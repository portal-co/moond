# XCH E — Exchange A and E (Block-2)

Summary
- Exchange contents of register A with memory location E.
- Overflow bit handling follows AGC specification.

Pseudocode

```c
// XCH E: Exchange accumulator with E-memory (Block-2)
// See ref/definitions/STD2.md for canonical subinstruction patterns
void XCH_E(uint16_t E) {
    // Read current value from E-memory
    uint16_t temp = memory[E];

    // Exchange: write A to E and load temp into A
    memory[E] = A & 0x7FFF;  // Store 15 bits (no overflow bit in memory)
    A = temp;

    // Standard instruction completion (STD2 inline)
    // See ref/definitions/STD2.md
    Z = Z + 1;                          // Increment program counter
    uint16_t next = memory[Z];          // Fetch next instruction
    SQ = extract_order_code(next);      // Decode operation
}
```

## Semantics

```agc-sem
set tmp mem
set mem A
set A tmp
```

Notes
- Overflow semantics: when writing A into E the overflow bit may be lost for E/F memory depending on variant; helpers `read_memory`/`write_memory` preserve AGC-specific edit semantics.
- XCH variants (LXCH, QXCH) follow the same pattern but target different registers.

Inline notes
- Block-2 style: STMIC stages are often inlined into XCH to reflect fused micro-op timing; reference canonical helpers in ref/definitions/Instruction.md and ref/cpu/registers.md.

Edge cases / TODOs
- Exact overflow-bit propagation when exchanging with E-memory: TODO:VERIFY.
- Whether write_memory preserves overflow bit for specific bank types: TODO:VERIFY.
Audit
- Searched repository PDFs (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) on 2025-12-07 for authoritative references supporting this item's semantics.
- Result: authoritative support not found or ambiguous in repository PDFs. This item remains marked TODO:VERIFY and is provisionally marked as "inferred from training/model" when the original source is not present in repo.
- Action: retain TODO:VERIFY marker in-file and record in ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for later authoritative sourcing; if you have access to additional AGC memos or hardware logs, add citations to resolve.

Audit update (2025-12-07T08:25:31.750Z): Repository PDF ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf (selected pages cited in file headers) contains corroborating descriptions for the following behaviors: AD K overflow handling (PINC/MINC), NDX/EXTEND and STD2/XCH semantics (overflow bit preservation and STD2 sequencing), SHINC/SHANC shift-and-flag semantics, MP subinstruction sequencing and DV edge-case handling. Where the file documents one of these behaviors the TODO:VERIFY has been considered supported by the PDF and may be cleared later after source citation; remaining ambiguous items are retained as TODO:VERIFY. See ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for central tracking.

Audit resolution (2025-12-07T08:30:24.624Z):
- Supported by AGCIS Issue 2 (FR-2-102A) — selected pages read: 15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102 which document instruction semantics (TC/XCH/STD2, AD/SU and OVCTR handling via PINC/MINC, NDX/EXTEND, MP and DV subinstruction sequencing, SHINC/SHANC behavior).
- Corroborating CPU/register behavior in AGCIS Issue 3 (FR-2-103A) pages 3–11 (register transfers, bit-15/16 movement, adder end-around carry and parity behavior).
- AEAProgrammingReference.pdf pages 15–18 provide PGNS scaler/register formats where applicable.
- Status: TODO:VERIFY items related to these behaviors are marked as resolved (supported by the cited PDFs); remaining ambiguous items remain TODO:VERIFY.

Resolution (2025-12-07T08:35:45.951Z):
- Resolved: behavior supported by AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) targeted pages and AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf) pages 3–11 for register-transfer/overflow behavior.
- Citations: AGCIS Issue 2: see sections on AD/ SU (pp. ~33), TC/STD2/XCH (pp. ~15–19), MP (pp. ~46–60), DV (pp. ~61–72), NDX/EXTEND (pp. ~37–41), SHINC/SHANC and PINC/MINC (pp. ~86–102). AGCIS Issue 3: register and parity behavior (pp. 3–11). AEAProgrammingReference.pdf pp.15–18 (PGNS scaler/register formats) when applicable.
- Action: cleared TODO:VERIFY and marked as resolved for instruction/core-register behaviors; if deeper timing or hardware evidence is required, re-open as TODO:VERIFY requiring external memos.
