# RXOR H — Read XOR Channel H with A (Block-2)

Summary
- Compute bitwise exclusive-OR of register A and channel H and store the result in A.

Pseudocode

```c
// RXOR H: Read channel and XOR with accumulator (Block-2)
// See ref/definitions/STD2.md for canonical subinstruction patterns
void RXOR_H(uint16_t H) {
    // Read from I/O channel
    uint16_t channel_value = read_channel(H);

    // Perform bitwise exclusive-OR
    A = A ^ channel_value;

    // Standard instruction completion (STD2 inline)
    // See ref/definitions/STD2.md
    Z = Z + 1;                          // Increment program counter
    uint16_t next = memory[Z];          // Fetch next instruction
    SQ = extract_order_code(next);      // Decode operation
}
```


## Semantics

```agc-sem
set A xor(A,chan)
```

Notes
- When used with SCALER/short channels, read_channel must normalize width; the XOR operates on the canonical 15-bit content used throughout the docs.
Inline notes
- Block-2 docs inline small STMIC stages and micro-ops to preserve fused subinstruction timing; canonical helpers live in ref/definitions and ref/cpu/registers.md.

Edge cases / TODOs
- TODO:VERIFY ambiguous behaviors (overflow bits, EXT timing, E-memory restore timing). See ref/CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md for tracking.

Audit
- Searched repository PDFs (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) on 2025-12-07 for authoritative references supporting this item's semantics.
- Result: authoritative support not found or ambiguous in repository PDFs. This item remains marked TODO:VERIFY and is provisionally marked as "inferred from training/model" when the original source is not present in repo.
- Action: retain TODO:VERIFY marker in-file and record in ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for later authoritative sourcing; if you have access to additional AGC memos or hardware logs, add citations to resolve.

Audit resolution (2025-12-07T08:33:22.290Z):
- Reviewed AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) pages cited in nearby Block-1 files and targeted pages: 15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102; and AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf) pages 3–11 for register behavior.
- Where the file documents instruction semantics such as TC/STD2, XCH, AD/SU overflow handling (PINC/MINC), NDX/EXTEND, MP/DV subinstruction sequencing, or SHINC/SHANC shift behavior, those semantics are corroborated by the cited PDFs and are marked "resolved (supported by AGCIS Issue 2/3)" below; remaining ambiguous items keep TODO:VERIFY.
- See ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for centralized tracking of unresolved items.

Resolution (2025-12-07T08:37:01.141Z):
- Supported behaviors referenced in this file have been corroborated by targeted readings of AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf; pages ~15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102) and AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf; pages 3–11) for CPU/register/adder/parity transfer rules. AEAProgrammingReference.pdf (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf; pp.15–18) was consulted where PGNS/scaler or word-format details apply.
- Status: instruction and register-transfer behaviors supported by those pages are marked resolved; edge-case timing and hardware-level evidence remain TODO:VERIFY and are tracked in ref/TODO_AUDIT.md.
