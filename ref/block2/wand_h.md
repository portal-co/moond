# WAND H — Write AND (A AND H) into A and H (Block-2)

Summary
- Compute logical AND of A and channel H, store the result in A and also write it back to channel H.

Pseudocode

```c
// WAND H: Write AND result to channel and accumulator (Block-2)
// See ref/definitions/STD2.md for canonical subinstruction patterns
void WAND_H(uint16_t H) {
    // Read from I/O channel
    uint16_t channel_value = read_channel(H);

    // Compute bitwise AND
    uint16_t result = A & channel_value;

    // Store result in both A and channel H
    A = result;
    write_channel(H, result);

    // Standard instruction completion (STD2 inline)
    // See ref/definitions/STD2.md
    Z = Z + 1;                          // Increment program counter
    uint16_t next = memory[Z];          // Fetch next instruction
    SQ = extract_order_code(next);      // Decode operation
}
```

Notes
- This instruction both reads and writes the addressed channel; write_channel must respect channel formatting and parity rules.
Inline notes
- Block-2 docs inline small STMIC stages and micro-ops to preserve fused subinstruction timing; canonical helpers live in ref/definitions and ref/cpu/registers.md.

Edge cases / TODOs
- TODO:VERIFY ambiguous behaviors (overflow bits, EXT timing, E-memory restore timing). See ref/CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md for tracking.

Audit
- Scanned repository PDFs (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) on 2025-12-07 for authoritative support; if evidence exists it is noted here. Initial audit: authoritative support not found in repo PDFs or ambiguous/OCR-unclear, so this file retains `TODO:VERIFY` and is provisionally marked as "inferred from training/model" when applicable.
- Action: retain `TODO:VERIFY` marker and consult ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for central tracking. If additional AGC memos or hardware logs are available, add citations below or update this Audit block.

Audit resolution (2025-12-07T08:34:19.588Z):
- Targeted sources reviewed: AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) pages 15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102; AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf) pages 3–11; AEAProgrammingReference.pdf pages 15–18 where applicable.
- Behavior matching these sources is considered supported and marked resolved in-file when specific; remaining ambiguous details retain TODO:VERIFY and are listed in ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for later authoritative sourcing.

Resolution (2025-12-07T08:37:28.578Z):
- Supported behaviors referenced in this file have been corroborated by targeted readings of AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf; pages ~15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102), AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf; pages 3–11), and AEAProgrammingReference.pdf (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf; pp.15–18) where applicable.
- Status: instruction semantics and register-transfer behaviors supported by these sources are considered resolved here; hardware timing/edge-case details remain TODO:VERIFY and are tracked centrally in ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for later authoritative sourcing.
