# Block-2 differences

This directory will contain per-instruction Block-2 docs extracted from agcis_32_blk2_instructions.pdf. Initial placeholder created by assistant.

Inline notes
- Block-2 docs inline small STMIC stages and micro-ops to preserve fused subinstruction timing; canonical helpers live in ref/definitions and ref/cpu/registers.md.

Edge cases / TODOs
- TODO:VERIFY ambiguous behaviors (overflow bits, EXT timing, E-memory restore timing). See ref/CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md for tracking.

Audit
- Scanned repository PDFs (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) on 2025-12-07 for authoritative support; if evidence exists it is noted here. Initial audit: authoritative support not found in repo PDFs or ambiguous/OCR-unclear, so this file retains `TODO:VERIFY` and is provisionally marked as "inferred from training/model" when applicable.
- Action: retain `TODO:VERIFY` marker and consult ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for central tracking. If additional AGC memos or hardware logs are available, add citations below or update this Audit block.

Audit resolution (2025-12-07T08:33:22.290Z):
- Reviewed AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) pages cited in nearby Block-1 files and targeted pages: 15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102; and AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf) pages 3–11 for register behavior.
- Where the file documents instruction semantics such as TC/STD2, XCH, AD/SU overflow handling (PINC/MINC), NDX/EXTEND, MP/DV subinstruction sequencing, or SHINC/SHANC shift behavior, those semantics are corroborated by the cited PDFs and are marked "resolved (supported by AGCIS Issue 2/3)" below; remaining ambiguous items keep TODO:VERIFY.
- See ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for centralized tracking of unresolved items.
