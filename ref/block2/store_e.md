# STORE E — Store from GSE into E (Block-2)

Summary
- Peripheral store: take data supplied by GSE (via WAts) and store into E. Bank registers/addresses provided by GSE.

Detailed pseudocode

void STORE_E(uint16_t E_from_gse) {
    // Data is provided via WArs by GSE; write into E
    uint16_t value = read_wats();
    write_memory(E_from_gse, value);
}

Notes
- When E is in E-memory, editing rules apply during the write; GSE provides bank selection where required.
Inline notes
- Block-2 docs inline small STMIC stages and micro-ops to preserve fused subinstruction timing; canonical helpers live in ref/definitions and ref/cpu/registers.md.

Edge cases / TODOs
- TODO:VERIFY ambiguous behaviors (overflow bits, EXT timing, E-memory restore timing). See ref/CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md for tracking.

Audit
- Scanned repository PDFs (ref/moon/AEAProgrammingReference.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf, ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) on 2025-12-07 for authoritative support; if evidence exists it is noted here. Initial audit: authoritative support not found in repo PDFs or ambiguous/OCR-unclear, so this file retains `TODO:VERIFY` and is provisionally marked as "inferred from training/model" when applicable.
- Action: retain `TODO:VERIFY` marker and consult ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for central tracking. If additional AGC memos or hardware logs are available, add citations below or update this Audit block.

Audit resolution (2025-12-07T08:34:19.588Z):
- Targeted sources reviewed: AGCIS Issue 2 (ref/moon/agcis_2_machine_instructions.pdf) pages 15–36, 46–60, 61–80, 86–102; AGCIS Issue 3 (ref/moon/agcis_3_central_processor.pdf) pages 3–11; AEAProgrammingReference.pdf pages 15–18 where applicable.
- Behavior matching these sources is considered supported and marked resolved in-file when specific; remaining ambiguous details retain TODO:VERIFY and are listed in ref/TODO_AUDIT.md for later authoritative sourcing.
